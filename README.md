tips to working with git and github

Name: Nic Rhoads

My major is data science proper, which is a fairly obscure major that a lot of people don't know about. I like to explain it as a mix between statistics and computer science--not a perfect explanation but it helps people get the gist.

My major three activites I have been doing have been working with algorithms in COM S 311, learning R in DS 202, and collaborating with others in my role as a UA in the Honors program.

My three main strategies for staying organized and doing tasks are planning out my weeks ahead of time, taking short but frequent breaks to not get burnt out, and sorting all of my assignments into a nice system to help keep track of all my work.
